# 🧮 ArithMatrix
### Intelligent Calculator with Voice, Camera & Currency Conversion

ArithMatrix is a modern, multi-modal calculator application built for user who want more than basic arithmetic.  
It blends typed input, voice interaction, camera-based expression recognition, and currency conversion into a single, clean, professional Android app.

The project is designed with clarity, correctness, and extensibility in mind, using modern Android architecture and best practices.

## 📌 Project Overview

ArithMatrix helps users:

- Perform full expression-based calculations (not just button-by-button math)
- Calculate hands-free using voice input
- Capture and solve expressions using the camera
- Convert currencies with precision
- Maintain persistent calculation history across all modes
- Reuse and manage past calculations easily

The app is minimal on the surface, yet powerful under the hood.

- Mode-aware history:
    - Basic
    - Voice
    - Camera
    - Currency

## 📐 Architecture (MVVM)

ArithMatrix uses the **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** architecture pattern:

**UI (Jetpack Compose)**  
Displays state and handles user interaction only.

**ViewModel**  
Holds UI state using StateFlow and contains all business logic.

**Repository**  
Acts as the single source of truth and mediates between UI and data sources.

**Room Database**  
Provides persistent local storage for calculation history.

### This architecture ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Testability
- Scalability
- Maintainability

## 🎨 UI & Design Philosophy

- Minimalist, distraction-free interface
- Professional color palette (not flashy)
- Adaptive light / dark theme
- Designed for one-hand usage
- No unnecessary visual noise

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Live currency exchange rates
- Advanced OCR for handwritten expressions
- Expression parsing from natural language
- Cloud sync for calculation history
- Tablet-optimized layouts
- Accessibility improvements (voice-first mode)
