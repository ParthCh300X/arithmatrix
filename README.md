# 🧮 ArithMatrix — Intelligent Calculator with Voice, Camera & Currency Conversion

ArithMatrix is a modern, multi-modal calculator application built for users who want more than basic arithmetic.  
It blends typed input, voice interaction, camera-based expression recognition, and currency conversion into a single, clean, professional Android app.

The project is designed with clarity, correctness, and extensibility in mind, using modern Android architecture and best practices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

ArithMatrix helps users:

- Perform full expression-based calculations (not just button-by-button math)
- Calculate hands-free using voice input
- Capture and solve expressions using the camera
- Convert currencies with precision
- Maintain persistent calculation history across all modes
- Reuse and manage past calculations easily

The app is minimal on the surface, yet powerful under the hood.
